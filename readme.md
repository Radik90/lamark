# lamark
next generation markup language.


## about:
lamark is for humans, not machines.

technically,  
it is something between YAML and Markdown.

it is extension-free, tool-free, renderer-free  
and even device-free â€“ you are free to use it on paper.


## first steps:
create _.txt_ file,  
open it in any text/code editor,  
start to structure your text lean on lamark spec sheet.

use monospaced fonts. Author like  
[JetBrains Mono NL](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) (NL is No Ligatures).

you are also free to use it directly in Markdown,  
using [code formatting feature](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks),  
in Slack or Telegram for example,  
it may seem handy for you.


## spec sheet / usage scenarios:
for ease of perception:  
- all items in lamark begin with lowercase letters.  
- sentences are broken up into new lines  
  according to their meaning.


### single-level list:
```
.. groceries:
   .. bananas
   .. lemonade
   .. rice brown
   .. bread
```


### multi-level list:
```
.. groceries:
   .. bananas
      .. mini
      .. classic
   .. lemonade
   .. rice brown
   .. bread
```
any depth is acceptable.


### multi-line item:
```
.. groceries:
   .. bananas
   .. lemonade
   .. rice brown
   .. bread
      gluten free
      sugar free
   .. cookies
      gluten free, sugar free
```
good for detailing.


### items in one-line, using multi-line:
```
.. groceries:
   bananas, lemonade, rice brown, bread
```
good for short items.


### when need to relate items, but header is not needed:
```
.. groceries:
   .. :
      .. bananas mini
      .. watermelon
      .. lemon
   .. :
      .. protein bars
      .. cookies
         gluten free
         sugar free
```


### remark / mini-comment / not list item:
```
.. groceries:
   .. rice brown
   .. bread
      ,. gluten free, sugar free
      .. brown
      .. wheat
```


### item needs is questionable / we have doubts / there is some uncertainty:
```
.. groceries:
   .. rice brown
   .. bread
      ,. gluten free, sugar free
      .. brown
      .. wheat
      .? loaf
```
notice dot position.


### item needed, but will be added later:
```
.. groceries:
   .. rice brown
   .. bread
      ,. gluten free, sugar free
      .. brown
      .. wheat
      .? loaf
      .. ...
```


### task management:
#### prioritization:
##### last-priority / probably not needed / difficulty in deciding to delete / preparing to be soon deleted:
```
.. groceries:
   9. bananas
   .. lemonade
   .. rice brown
   .. bread
   .. water
```


##### first-priority / asap / important / burning:
```
.. groceries:
   .. bananas
   1. lemonade
   .. rice brown
   .. bread
   1. water
```


##### second-priority / also important, but not for first:
```
.. groceries:
   2. bananas
   1. lemonade
   .. rice brown
   .. bread
   1. water
```

three numbers are supposed to be used:  
***1***, ***2*** and ***9***.  

at the same time,  
these numbers can be used many times.


#### done:
most convenient solution at the moment  
is next:

save an original list  
and work with a new copy  
by deleting done items in-place.


### combinations / using together:
mini-comment with doubts:
```
.. groceries:
   .. rice brown
   .. bread
      ,. gluten free, sugar free
      ,? hypoallergenic
      .. brown
      .. wheat
```

setting ***probably not needed*** for related items without header:
```
.. groceries:
   .. :
      .. bananas mini
      .. watermelon
      .. lemon
      .. ...
   9. :
      .. protein bars
      .. cookies
         gluten free
         sugar free
```


## versioning and release strategy:

```
branches and versions:

.. master-branch name:
   master
   ,. default branch.
   ,. branch is read-only.
   ,. branch for stable versions.
   ,. stable versions called like v2.3.[1-99].
   ,. each commit in this branch
      is a new release,
      so commit message should be called like
      "release v2.3.1".

.. development-branch name:
   v2.3.draft
   ,. branch for development new stable version.
   ,. branch open for contributions
      via pull requests.

,. information about switching to v2.4.*
   will be available later.

,. all in this project,
   including spec sheet and project description, 
   are one document (current) with
   one actual release-version,
   so any changes, 
   even changes in description,
   need to have new release.

,. first two numbers in the version (v*.*)  
   correspond to the year.
```
